## Migrating from earlier versions

### V2 to V3

We have published [a migration guide on our docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/js-sdk-v2-to-v3-migration-guide), showing how to move from v2 to v3.

### V3.\* to V3.4

We recommend using only documented interfaces, as we strictly follow semantic versioning (semver) and breaking changes may occur for undocumented interfaces. To ensure compatibility, consider pinning your versions if you need to use undocumented interfaces.

## Installation

You can install this SDK directly from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepgram/sdk).

```bash
npm install @deepgram/sdk
# - or -
# yarn add @deepgram/sdk
```

### UMD

You can now use plain `<script>`s to import deepgram from CDNs, like:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@deepgram/sdk"></script>
```

or even:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@deepgram/sdk"></script>
```

Then you can use it from a global deepgram variable:

```html
<script>
  const { createClient } = deepgram;
  const _deepgram = createClient("deepgram-api-key");

  console.log("Deepgram Instance: ", _deepgram);
  // ...
</script>
```

### ESM

You can now use type="module" `<script>`s to import deepgram from CDNs, like:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { createClient } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@deepgram/sdk/+esm";
  const deepgram = createClient("deepgram-api-key");

  console.log("Deepgram Instance: ", deepgram);
  // ...
</script>
```

## Initialization

```js
import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
// - or -
// const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

const deepgram = createClient(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);
```

### Getting an API Key

🔑 To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

## Scoped Configuration

The SDK supports scoped configuration. You'll be able to configure various aspects of each namespace of the SDK from the initialization. Below outlines a flexible and customizable configuration system for the Deepgram SDK. Here’s how the namespace configuration works:

### 1. Global Defaults

- The `global` namespace serves as the foundational configuration applicable across all other namespaces unless overridden.
- Includes general settings like URL and headers applicable for all API calls.
- If no specific configurations are provided for other namespaces, the `global` defaults are used.

### 2. Namespace-specific Configurations

- Each namespace (`listen`, `manage`, `onprem`, `read`, `speak`) can have its specific configurations which override the `global` settings within their respective scopes.
- Allows for detailed control over different parts of the application interacting with various Deepgram API endpoints.

### 3. Transport Options

- Configurations for both `fetch` and `websocket` can be specified under each namespace, allowing different transport mechanisms for different operations.
- For example, the `fetch` configuration can have its own URL and proxy settings distinct from the `websocket`.
- The generic interfaces define a structure for transport options which include a client (like a `fetch` or `WebSocket` instance) and associated options (like headers, URL, proxy settings).

This configuration system enables robust customization where defaults provide a foundation, but every aspect of the client's interaction with the API can be finely controlled and tailored to specific needs through namespace-specific settings. This enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application by localizing configurations to their relevant contexts.

### 4. Examples

#### Change the API url used for all SDK methods

Useful for using different API environments (for e.g. beta).

```js
import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
// - or -
// const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

const deepgram = createClient(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, {
  global: { fetch: { options: { url: "https://api.beta.deepgram.com" } } },
});
```

#### Change the API url used for transcription only

Useful for on-prem installations. Only affects requests to `/listen` endpoints.

```js
import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
// - or -
// const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

const deepgram = createClient(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, {
  listen: { fetch: { options: { url: "http://localhost:8080" } } },
});
```

#### Override fetch transmitter

Useful for providing a custom http client.

```js
import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
// - or -
// const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

const yourFetch = async () => {
  return Response("...etc");
};

const deepgram = createClient(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, {
  global: { fetch: { client: yourFetch } },
});
```

#### Proxy requests in the browser

This SDK now works in the browser. If you'd like to make REST-based requests (pre-recorded transcription, on-premise, and management requests), then you'll need to use a proxy as we do not support custom CORS origins on our API. To set up your proxy, you configure the SDK like so:

```js
import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const deepgram = createClient("proxy", {
  global: { fetch: { options: { proxy: { url: "http://localhost:8080" } } } },
});
```

> Important: You must pass `"proxy"` as your API key, and use the proxy to set the `Authorization` header to your Deepgram API key.

Your proxy service should replace the Authorization header with `Authorization: token <DEEPGRAM_API_KEY>` and return results verbatim to the SDK.

Check out our example Node-based proxy here: [Deepgram Node Proxy](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-node-proxy).

#### Set custom headers for fetch

Useful for many things.

```js
import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const deepgram = createClient("proxy", {
  global: { fetch: { options: { headers: { "x-custom-header": "foo" } } } },
});
```

## Transcription (Synchronous)

### Remote Files

```js
const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
  {
    url: "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav",

dgConnection.on(LiveTTSEvents.Open, () => {
  console.log("Connection opened");

  // Send text data for TTS synthesis
  dgConnection.sendText(text);

  // Send Flush message to the server after sending the text
  dgConnection.flush();

  dgConnection.on(LiveTTSEvents.Close, () => {
    console.log("Connection closed");
  });
});
```

[See our API reference for more info](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/text-to-speech-api).

## Text Intelligence

```js
const text = `The history of the phrase 'The quick brown fox jumps over the
lazy dog'. The earliest known appearance of the phrase was in The Boston
Journal. In an article titled "Current Notes" in the February 9, 1885, edition,
the phrase is mentioned as a good practice sentence for writing students: "A
favorite copy set by writing teachers for their pupils is the following,
because it contains every letter of the alphabet: 'A quick brown fox jumps over
the lazy dog.'" Dozens of other newspapers published the phrase over the
next few months, all using the version of the sentence starting with "A" rather
than "The". The earliest known use of the phrase starting with "The" is from
the 1888 book Illustrative Shorthand by Linda Bronson.[3] The modern form
(starting with "The") became more common even though it is slightly longer than
the original (starting with "A").`;

const { result, error } = await deepgram.read.analyzeText(
