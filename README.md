## Documentation

API reference documentation is available [here](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/deepgram-api-overview).

## Migrating from earlier versions

### V2 to V3

We have published [a migration guide on our docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/js-sdk-v2-to-v3-migration-guide), showing how to move from v2 to v3.

### V3.\* to V3.4

We recommend using only documented interfaces, as we strictly follow semantic versioning (semver) and breaking changes may occur for undocumented interfaces. To ensure compatibility, consider pinning your versions if you need to use undocumented interfaces.

### V3.\* to V4

The Voice Agent interfaces have been updated to use the new Voice Agent V1 API. Please refer to our [Documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/voice-agent-v1-migration) on Migration to new V1 Agent API.

### V4 to V5

The SDK has been rebuilt using [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com) for auto-generation, providing better TypeScript support and a more structured API. **See [MIGRATION_GUIDE_V4_TO_V5.md](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk/blob/naomi/autogenerated/MIGRATION_GUIDE_V4_TO_V5.md) for a comprehensive migration guide.**

Key breaking changes:
- Client initialization: `createClient()` → `new DeepgramClient()`
- Options property: `key` → `apiKey`
- API methods now include version namespaces (e.g., `listen.v1.media.transcribeUrl()`)
- Error handling: Use try/catch instead of `{ result, error }` pattern

## Installation

```sh
npm i -s @deepgram/sdk
```

## Authentication

The Deepgram SDK supports three authentication methods:

### 1. API Key Authentication (Recommended)

Uses `Token` scheme in Authorization header.

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

// Method 1: Pass API key in options object
const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" });

// Method 2: Use environment variable (DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)
const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient();
```

### 2. Access Token Authentication

Uses `Bearer` scheme in Authorization header. Access tokens are temporary (30-second TTL) and must be obtained using an API key.

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

// Pass access token as apiKey property
const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({ accessToken: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" });

// Or use environment variable (DEEPGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN)
const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient();
```

### 3. Proxy Authentication

For browser environments or custom proxy setups. Pass `"proxy"` as the API key.

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({
  apiKey: "proxy",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080"
});
```

> **Important**: Your proxy must set the `Authorization: token DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` header and forward requests to Deepgram's API.

### Getting Credentials

#### API Keys

Create API keys via the Management API:

```js
const data = await deepgramClient.manage.v1.keys.create(projectId, {
  comment: "My API key",
  scopes: ["usage:write"],
});
```

**Endpoint**: `POST https://api.deepgram.com/v1/projects/:projectId/keys`

#### Access Tokens

Generate temporary access tokens (requires existing API key):

```js
const data = await deepgramClient.auth.v1.tokens.grant();
// Returns: { access_token: string, expires_in: 30 }
```

**Endpoint**: `POST https://api.deepgram.com/v1/auth/grant`

### Environment Variables

The SDK automatically checks for credentials in this priority order:

1. `DEEPGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` (highest priority)
2. `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` (fallback)

### Getting an API Key

🔑 To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

## Scoped Configuration

The SDK supports scoped configuration. You'll be able to configure various aspects of each namespace of the SDK from the initialization. Below outlines a flexible and customizable configuration system for the Deepgram SDK. Here's how the namespace configuration works:

### Global Defaults

- The `global` namespace serves as the foundational configuration applicable across all other namespaces unless overridden.
- Includes general settings like URL and headers applicable for all API calls.
- If no specific configurations are provided for other namespaces, the `global` defaults are used.

### Namespace-specific Configurations

- Each namespace (`listen`, `manage`, `onprem`, `read`, `speak`) can have its specific configurations which override the `global` settings within their respective scopes.
- Allows for detailed control over different parts of the application interacting with various Deepgram API endpoints.

### Transport Options

- Configurations for both `fetch` and `websocket` can be specified under each namespace, allowing different transport mechanisms for different operations.
- For example, the `fetch` configuration can have its own URL and proxy settings distinct from the `websocket`.
- The generic interfaces define a structure for transport options which include a client (like a `fetch` or `WebSocket` instance) and associated options (like headers, URL, proxy settings).

This configuration system enables robust customization where defaults provide a foundation, but every aspect of the client's interaction with the API can be finely controlled and tailored to specific needs through namespace-specific settings. This enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application by localizing configurations to their relevant contexts.

### Examples

#### Change the API url used for all SDK methods

Useful for using different API environments (for e.g. beta).

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
// - or -
// const { DeepgramClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({
  apiKey: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: "https://api.beta.deepgram.com"
});
```

#### Change the API url used for the Voice Agent websocket

Useful for using a voice agent proxy (for e.g. 3rd party provider auth).

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
// - or -
// const { DeepgramClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({
  apiKey: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: "ws://localhost:8080"
});
```

#### Change the API url used for transcription only

Useful for on-prem installations. Only affects requests to `/listen` endpoints.

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
// - or -
// const { DeepgramClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({
  apiKey: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080"
});
```

#### Override fetch transmitter

Useful for providing a custom http client.

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";
// - or -
// const { DeepgramClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

const yourFetch = async () => {
  return Response("...etc");
};

const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({
  apiKey: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
  fetch: yourFetch
});
```

#### Proxy requests in the browser

This SDK now works in the browser. If you'd like to make REST-based requests (pre-recorded transcription, on-premise, and management requests), then you'll need to use a proxy as we do not support custom CORS origins on our API. To set up your proxy, you configure the SDK like so:

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({
  apiKey: "proxy",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080"
});
```

> Important: You must pass `"proxy"` as your API key, and use the proxy to set the `Authorization` header to your Deepgram API key.

Your proxy service should replace the Authorization header with `Authorization: token <DEEPGRAM_API_KEY>` and return results verbatim to the SDK.

Check out our example Node-based proxy here: [Deepgram Node Proxy](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-node-proxy).

#### Set custom headers for fetch

Useful for many things.

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  headers: { "x-custom-header": "foo" }
});
```

## Browser Usage

The SDK works in modern browsers with some considerations:

### WebSocket Features (Full Support)

- **Live Transcription**: ✅ Direct connection to `wss://api.deepgram.com`
- **Voice Agent**: ✅ Direct connection to `wss://agent.deepgram.com`
- **Live Text-to-Speech**: ✅ Direct connection to `wss://api.deepgram.com`

### REST API Features (Proxy Required)

- **Pre-recorded Transcription**: ⚠️ Requires proxy due to CORS
- **Text Intelligence**: ⚠️ Requires proxy due to CORS
- **Management APIs**: ⚠️ Requires proxy due to CORS

### Setup Options

#### Option 1: CDN (UMD)

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@deepgram/sdk"></script>
<script>
  const { DeepgramClient } = deepgram;
  const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
</script>
```

#### Option 2: CDN (ESM)

```html
<script type="module">
  import { DeepgramClient } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@deepgram/sdk/+esm";
  const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
</script>
```

#### Option 3: NPM Package (Browser Bundle)

After installing via `npm install @deepgram/sdk`, you can use the browser bundle:

**Method A: Copy the bundle to your public directory**

```bash
# Copy the browser bundle to your static assets folder
cp node_modules/@deepgram/sdk/dist/browser/index.global.js public/deepgram.js
```

Then include it in your HTML:

```html
<script src="/deepgram.js"></script>
<script>
  const { DeepgramClient } = Deepgram;
  const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
</script>
```

**Method B: Reference directly from node_modules (development only)**

If your dev server serves files from `node_modules`, you can reference it directly:

```html
<script src="/node_modules/@deepgram/sdk/dist/browser/index.global.js"></script>
<script>
  const { DeepgramClient } = Deepgram;
  const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
</script>
```

**Method C: Use a bundler (Webpack, Vite, etc.)**

Import the SDK in your JavaScript/TypeScript code and let your bundler handle it:

```js
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
```

```js
const data = await deepgramClient.auth.v1.tokens.get();
```

**API Endpoint**: `GET https://api.deepgram.com/v1/auth/token`

[See our API reference for more info](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/authentication)

### Grant Access Token

Creates a temporary access token with a 30-second TTL. Requires an existing API key for authentication.

```js
// Create a temporary access token
const data = await deepgramClient.auth.v1.tokens.grant();

// Use the access token in a new client instance
const tempClient = new DeepgramClient({ apiKey: data.access_token });
```

**API Endpoint**: `POST https://api.deepgram.com/v1/auth/grant`

> **Important**: You _must_ pass an `accessToken` property to use a temporary token. Passing the token as a raw string will treat it as an API key and use the incorrect authorization scheme.

### Debugging and making changes locally

If you want to make local changes to the SDK and run the [`examples/`](./examples/), you'll need to `pnpm build` first, to ensure that your changes are included in the examples that are running.

## Getting Help

We love to hear from you so if you have questions, comments or find a bug in the
project, let us know! You can either:

- [Open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-node-sdk/issues/new)
- [Join the Deepgram Discord Community](https://discord.gg/xWRaCDBtW4)
- [Join the Deepgram Github Discussions Community](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions)

## Request And Response Types

The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. Simply import them with the
following namespace:

```typescript
import { Deepgram } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const request: Deepgram.GrantV1Request = {
    ...
};
```

## Exception Handling

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
will be thrown.

```typescript
import { DeepgramError } from "@deepgram/sdk";

try {
    await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(...);
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof DeepgramError) {
        console.log(err.statusCode);
        console.log(err.message);
        console.log(err.body);
        console.log(err.rawResponse);
    }
}
```

## File Uploads

You can upload files using the client:

```typescript
import { createReadStream } from "fs";

await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(createReadStream("path/to/file"), ...);
await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(new ReadableStream(), ...);
await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(Buffer.from('binary data'), ...);
await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(new Blob(['binary data'], { type: 'audio/mpeg' }), ...);
await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(new File(['binary data'], 'file.mp3'), ...);
await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(new ArrayBuffer(8), ...);
await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), ...);
```
The client accepts a variety of types for file upload parameters:
* Stream types: `fs.ReadStream`, `stream.Readable`, and `ReadableStream`
* Buffered types: `Buffer`, `Blob`, `File`, `ArrayBuffer`, `ArrayBufferView`, and `Uint8Array`

### Metadata

You can configure metadata when uploading a file:
```typescript
const file: Uploadable.WithMetadata = {
    data: createReadStream("path/to/file"),
    filename: "my-file",       // optional
    contentType: "audio/mpeg", // optional
    contentLength: 1949,       // optional
};
```

Alternatively, you can upload a file directly from a file path:
```typescript
const file : Uploadable.FromPath = {
    path: "path/to/file",
    filename: "my-file",        // optional
    contentType: "audio/mpeg",  // optional
    contentLength: 1949,        // optional
};
```

The metadata is used to set the `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`, and `Content-Disposition` headers. If not provided, the client will attempt to determine them automatically.
For example, `fs.ReadStream` has a `path` property which the SDK uses to retrieve the file size from the filesystem without loading it into memory.


## Binary Response

You can consume binary data from endpoints using the `BinaryResponse` type which lets you choose how to consume the data:

```typescript
const response = await client.speak.v1.audio.generate(...);
const stream: ReadableStream<Uint8Array> = response.stream();
// const arrayBuffer: ArrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
// const blob: Blob = response.blob();
// const bytes: Uint8Array = response.bytes();
// You can only use the response body once, so you must choose one of the above methods.
// If you want to check if the response body has been used, you can use the following property.
const bodyUsed = response.bodyUsed;
```

## Advanced

### Additional Headers

If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `headers` request option.

```typescript
const response = await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(..., {
    headers: {
        'X-Custom-Header': 'custom value'
    }
});
```

### Additional Query String Parameters

If you would like to send additional query string parameters as part of the request, use the `queryParams` request option.

```typescript
const response = await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(..., {
    queryParams: {
        'customQueryParamKey': 'custom query param value'
    }
});
```

### Retries

The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
retry limit (default: 2).

A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

- [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
- [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
- [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

```typescript
const response = await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(..., {
    maxRetries: 0 // override maxRetries at the request level
});
```

### Timeouts

The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to configure this behavior.

```typescript
const response = await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(..., {
    timeoutInSeconds: 30 // override timeout to 30s
});
```

### Aborting Requests

The SDK allows users to abort requests at any point by passing in an abort signal.

```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const response = await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(..., {
    abortSignal: controller.signal
});
controller.abort(); // aborts the request
```

### Access Raw Response Data

The SDK provides access to raw response data, including headers, through the `.withRawResponse()` method.
The `.withRawResponse()` method returns a promise that results to an object with a `data` and a `rawResponse` property.

```typescript
const { data, rawResponse } = await client.listen.v1.media.transcribeFile(...).withRawResponse();

console.log(data);
console.log(rawResponse.headers['X-My-Header']);
```

### Logging

The SDK supports logging. You can configure the logger by passing in a `logging` object to the client options.

```typescript
import { DeepgramClient, logging } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const client = new DeepgramClient({
    ...
    logging: {
        level: logging.LogLevel.Debug, // defaults to logging.LogLevel.Info
        logger: new logging.ConsoleLogger(), // defaults to ConsoleLogger
        silent: false, // defaults to true, set to false to enable logging
    }
});
```
The `logging` object can have the following properties:
- `level`: The log level to use. Defaults to `logging.LogLevel.Info`.
- `logger`: The logger to use. Defaults to a `logging.ConsoleLogger`.
- `silent`: Whether to silence the logger. Defaults to `true`.

The `level` property can be one of the following values:
- `logging.LogLevel.Debug`
- `logging.LogLevel.Info`
- `logging.LogLevel.Warn`
- `logging.LogLevel.Error`

To provide a custom logger, you can pass in an object that implements the `logging.ILogger` interface.

<details>
<summary>Custom logger examples</summary>

Here's an example using the popular `winston` logging library.
```ts
import winston from 'winston';

const winstonLogger = winston.createLogger({...});

const logger: logging.ILogger = {
    debug: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.debug(msg, ...args),
    info: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.info(msg, ...args),
    warn: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.warn(msg, ...args),
    error: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.error(msg, ...args),
};
```

Here's an example using the popular `pino` logging library.

```ts
import pino from 'pino';

const pinoLogger = pino({...});

const logger: logging.ILogger = {
  debug: (msg, ...args) => pinoLogger.debug(args, msg),
  info: (msg, ...args) => pinoLogger.info(args, msg),
  warn: (msg, ...args) => pinoLogger.warn(args, msg),
  error: (msg, ...args) => pinoLogger.error(args, msg),
};
```
</details>


### Runtime Compatibility


The SDK works in the following runtimes:



- Node.js 18+
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Workers
- Deno v1.25+
- Bun 1.0+
- React Native

### Customizing Fetch Client

The SDK provides a way for you to customize the underlying HTTP client / Fetch function. If you're running in an
unsupported environment, this provides a way for you to break glass and ensure the SDK works.

```typescript
import { DeepgramClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

const client = new DeepgramClient({
    ...
    fetcher: // provide your implementation here
});
```

## Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code,
otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as
a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening
an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
