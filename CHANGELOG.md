## [Unreleased]

---

## [1.2.4]

### Fixed

- Getting the list of API keys was returning the wrong type of object. The SDK now returns the correct object type, but also returns what was previously implemented with deprecation notices.
- The `version` parameter was typed as required for both pre-recorded and live transcription. Changed this to be optional.

## [1.2.2]

### Updated

- Updated the `wordBase` type to include an optional `speaker` property.
- Updated the documentation for the speaker property of the `utterance` type.

## [1.2.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused real-time transcriptions to not close correctly. This
  would result in the user not received the final transcription.

## [1.2.0]

### Updated

- Updated the `keys.create` function to allow new `expirationDate` or `timeToLive`
  values. These are optional and one at most can be provided. Providing both will
  throw an error.

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- Prerecorded transcription responses can now be used to generate WebVTT and
  SRT caption files. Example:

  ```js
  const response = await deepgram.transcription.preRecorded(
    { url: "URL_TO_FILE" },
    {
      punctuate: true,
      utterances: true,
    }
  );
  const webVTT = response.toWebVTT();
  const SRT = response.toSRT();
  ```

  The [utterances](https://developers.deepgram.com/documentation/features/utterances/)
  feature is required to use this functionality.

## [1.0.3]

### Added

- In addition to a Url and Buffer, `trascricription.preRecorded` now accepts a
  ReadStream as a source of the file to transcribe.

### Updated

- Removed a console log that occurred when an HTTP request ended

## [1.0.2]

### Added

- `deepgram.projects.update` will now update a project
- Prerecorded transcription responses now include utterances

### Updated

- The project type has been modified to the following:

```ts
{
  project_id: string;
  name?: string;
  company?: string;
};
```

- The key type has been modified to the following:

```ts
{
  api_key_id: string;
  key?: string;
  comment: string;
  created: string;
  scopes: Array<string>;
};
```

- The usage request type has been modified to the following:

```ts
{
  request_id: string;
  created: string;
  path: string;
  accessor: string;
  response?: UsageRequestDetail | UsageRequestMessage;
  callback?: UsageCallback;
};
```

## [1.0.0]

### Added

#### Live transcription

- `deepgram.transcription.live` now manages a websocket connection to Deepgram's API
  for live transcription

#### Projects

- `deepgram.projects` allows listing projects or getting a specific project from
  your Deepgram account

### Updated

#### Pre-recorded transcription

- `deepgram.batch` has been moved to `deepgram.transcription.preRecorded`
- Type of `source` parameter of pre-recorded transcriptions has changed. You can now
  send one of two types of objects: `{ url: YOUR_FILES_URL }` or
  `{ buffer: BUFFER_OF_YOUR_FILE, mimetype: FILES_MIME_TYPE }`

#### API Key management

- All `deepgram.keys` methods now require a `projectId`.
- `deepgram.keys.create` now requires an additional parameter `scopes`. This is a
  string array specifying the scopes available to the newly created API key

## [0.6.5]

- Added notice to README to denote the library is in a very unstable state.

## [0.6.4]

### Added

- `transcribe` method will now return transcription results for both urls or buffers.
- `keys` now provides `create`, `list`, and `delete` methods that allow managing of
  API keys.
